# Self Critique

---

### What Did We Do Well?

- Good communication
- Good separation of frontend and backend
- Solid Filtering + Sorting
- Searching is "Google Like"
- Robust API (can survive a DDOS)

---

### What Did We Learn?

- How to use React
- How to set up an API
- AWS
- Sometimes the best solution is to make it yourself
- Don't DDOS yourself (API calls in `render()` are bad)

---

### What Could We Do Better?

- Bi-Weekly "Hackathons"
- Frontend aesthetics could use work
- Frontend code quality could use improvement
- More data

---

### What Puzzles Us?

- Asynchronous programming
- Selenium testing
- D3 + React
- Why some big websites have bad APIs
